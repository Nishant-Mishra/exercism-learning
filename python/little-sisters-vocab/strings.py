You are helping your younger sister with her English vocabulary homework, which she's finding very tedious. Her class is learning to create new words by adding prefixes and suffixes. Given a set of words, the teacher is looking for correctly transformed words with correct spelling by adding the prefix to the beginning or the suffix to the ending.

There's four activities in the assignment, each with a set of text or words to work with.
